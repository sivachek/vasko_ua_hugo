<p>Environment law is no longer confined to compliance or transactional issues. Widespread adoption of laws and agreements regulating the impact of activities on the environment - from chemicals use to climate change - means greater potential liability for business. You are expected to comply with the rules wherever you operate, yet need to make local activities reflect global strategies that incorporate principles of corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Meanwhile, new rules and the use of market mechanisms to regulate environmental impacts also mean new business opportunities.</p>

<p>We can help you not only comply with regulations but also to enhance your competitiveness and pursue environmental and carbon investment opportunities. Our lawyers provide advice on a wide range of non contentious advisory and transactional work and on civil, criminal and administrative contentious work, comprising:</p>

<ul>
<li>Environmental, health and safety requirements</li>
<li>Implementation of government programs</li>
<li>Formulating environmental management systems and policies</li>
<li>Civil disputes (nuisance, warranties, indemnities, judicial reviews, contractual disputes etc)</li>
<li>Directors' and officers' liabilities for environment risks</li>
<li>Energy performance of buildings, carbon reduction commitment and feed in tariffs</li>
<li>Environment audits, risk assessments and environmental management systems</li>
<li>Environment risks in insolvency situations</li>
<li>Environment-based economic and fiscal instruments</li>
<li>Instructing and working with technical environment specialists</li>
<li>Insurance of environment risks</li>
<li>Permitting of facilities and operations</li>
<li>Project implementation under the framework of Kyoto protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>We advise on international, regional and local legal frameworks that regulate climate change and help structure cross-border and domestic carbon trades and carbon investments. We also assist in international negotiations, the formulation of climate law policy, and project development in the areas of carbon transactions, renewable energy and greenhouse gas reform.</p>
